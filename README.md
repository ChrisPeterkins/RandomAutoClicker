# RandomAutoClicker
This program aims to let the user produce random clicks with their mouse. The RAC allows the user to select the area of the screen in
which they would like to click as well as which mouse button to use and how long to wait between clicks. The program has random
functionality built-in available to the user.

This project was designed in mind to "best" simple video game cheat detection services. The idea was to use native randomness to simulate
paternless clicks within certain bounds of the screen. There was no malicious intent in the creation and design of this program.
And I do not encourage or condone the use of this program for malicious intent.

Other uses of this program could be continuously keeping a TV Screen on, or something of the like. 

Credits to Murgee Auto Clicker for various influences in the design of this program.
